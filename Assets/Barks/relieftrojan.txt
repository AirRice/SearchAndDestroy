Phew! I think I was pretty close to being spotted there. No worries now.
You may not realise it, but you were pretty close to catching me there. Just wait and see.
Close one! I slipped away just in time. Now to find a new spot before you catch on again.
That was a close call! I think I managed to slip through for now. Better luck next time, scanners!
