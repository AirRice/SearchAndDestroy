Aw, why'd you have to show up? I was gonna go for that one, you know.
Well, that didn’t go as expected. Back to the drawing board!
Looks like that plan fizzled out. Time to rethink my approach.
Ugh, I thought that would work. Guess it’s time to try something new.
So much for that strategy. I’ll have to come up with a new trick.
That was a bust. I need a better way to outsmart them.
Well, that didn’t pan out. I’ll need to adjust my game plan.
Seems like my last move was a flop. I need to get more creative.
That didn’t go as planned. I’m going to have to regroup and re-strategize. Give me a moment?
Looks like I miscalculated. No matter, I'll just re-evaluate and adapt.
That attempt was a letdown. I guess I’ll have to think on my feet.
