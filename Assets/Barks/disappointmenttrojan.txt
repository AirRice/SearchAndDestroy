Aw, why'd you have to show up? I was gonna go for that one, you know.
Well, that didn’t go as expected. Back to the drawing board!
Looks like that plan fizzled out. Time to rethink my approach.
Ugh, I thought that would work. Guess it’s time to try something new.
So much for that strategy. I’ll have to come up with a new trick.
That was a bust. I need a better way to outsmart them.
Well, that didn’t pan out. I’ll need to adjust my game plan.
Seems like my last move was a flop. I need to get more creative.
That didn’t go as planned. I’m going to have to regroup and re-strategize. Give me a moment?
Looks like I miscalculated. No matter, I'll just re-evaluate and adapt.
That attempt was a letdown. I guess I’ll have to think on my feet.
You guys are really putting the pressure on me! I might have to step up my game if I want to stay hidden.
Ugh, I thought I had a great spot! But it looks like you’re all too sharp for me.
Wow, I really underestimated your scanning skills. This is getting intense!
I was just about to make a move, but then you all showed up! So much for my master plan.
You guys are like bloodhounds! I can feel the heat, and it’s making me nervous.
I thought I was being sneaky, but I guess I'm not as clever as I thought. This is wild!
This game really brings out the detective in all of you! I might need to rethink my strategy.
Why does it feel like you all are coordinating against me? Can’t a Trojan have some fun?
I’ve got to hand it to you guys; your teamwork is impressive. I’m sweating over here!
Alright, alright, I’ll admit it. You’re all better than I thought! Unfortunately for me, that is.
I might have to start playing mind games to keep you all off my scent. This is getting serious!
You’ve all got your eyes peeled! It’s like I’m playing hide and seek with the best.
Why is everyone so focused on me? Can’t we just enjoy a nice game without all this tension?
Okay, I’ll give you credit; you’re really good at this! Just wait until I pull a surprise move!
Every time I think I’m safe, someone comes sniffing around! Talk about pressure!
I can’t tell if you’re all working together or if I’m just imagining it. This is intense!
You all keep making me rethink my next move! I need to stay one step ahead here!
I didn't think you could be this organized! Guess I underestimated the Scanners this time.
Ugh, I thought I had a good hiding spot! You all are way too good at this.
Okay, okay, you got me! But I promise the next round will be way more interesting.
Hey, don’t celebrate too early! I might still have a trick or two up my sleeve.
I love how intense this has become! It’s like a game of cat and mouse.
Wow, this is way more fun than I thought it would be! You guys are really giving me a run for my money.
Every time I think I’m safe, someone comes and ruins it for me!
I’m really starting to feel the heat here! You all are relentless.
I had a whole strategy planned, and it’s all falling apart now!
