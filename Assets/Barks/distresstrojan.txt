Oh dear, you're really putting on a lot of pressure.
You’re nearly on my tail... I can’t afford a mistake now.
Things are getting a little too close for comfort. Anyone else feeling the squeeze?
Whoa, things are heating up! I didn’t think you’d find me that soon!
Yeah, I kinda knew this was going to happen. Shame.
My tactics aren’t working… I need to rethink my approach.
This isn’t going as planned. I’ve definitely underestimated you all.
You're making this harder than I expected.
Hmm... I think I need a new angle of approach.
