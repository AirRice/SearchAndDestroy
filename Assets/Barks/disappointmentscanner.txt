I thought for sure you'd be over there. What's this about now?
I'm starting to think we're all just reacting to the Trojan's moves instead of making our own.
Can we try to anticipate the Trojan's next move instead of just reacting to it?
Oh, come on! I really thought the Trojan was right there. Oh well...
Aw, I really expected the Trojan to be somewhere around here. The net's widened again now, we gotta focus.
Wow, this game is tougher than I thought! I’m starting to wonder if we’ll ever find this Trojan.
I swear, every time I scan, I just feel like I'm chasing shadows. Can someone please help me figure out a better plan?
Alright team, let’s regroup for a second. We need to strategize better if we want to catch this sneaky virus!
I can’t believe how elusive this Trojan is! It’s like it’s dancing around us or something.
Ugh, I thought we had a solid lead! Guess we’re back to square one again.
Every scan seems to lead us in circles. We need to adjust our approach if we’re going to corner this thing.
Let’s make sure we’re all on the same page. Communication is key if we’re going to outsmart this Trojan!
Aw man... Alright, let’s not lose hope. We’ve still got plenty of ground to cover and the Trojan can’t hide forever.
Man, this is like trying to find a needle in a haystack! Who knew this would be this challenging?
I feel like I’m just throwing darts blindfolded here. Maybe we need a different strategy to flush it out.
This Trojan is like a magician. One minute they're here, and the next they're gone! We need to find a way to trap them somehow.
Can we take a moment to brainstorm? I think we could benefit from a fresh set of eyes on our strategy.
I really thought we had a lock on it this time. Guess that Trojan is just playing hard to get!
We need to start thinking outside the box. What if the Trojan is using some kind of trick we haven't considered?
I know it’s frustrating, but let’s keep our spirits up! We’ve got this—eventually, we’ll catch that pesky virus.
Why do I feel like the Trojan is just laughing at us? We need to come up with something clever to outsmart it.
Let’s not forget to keep track of our scans. Patterns might emerge if we look closely enough!
I’m almost starting to suspect this Trojan has a secret passageway we don’t know about. We have to be smarter about this.
Alright, enough with the guessing games! It’s time to pull together and put our heads together to outsmart this Trojan!
Honestly, I thought we had it pinned down this time. I’m starting to feel like the Trojan has some kind of magic trick up its sleeve.
Man, I really thought we were onto something there. It's like the Trojan is just toying with us at this point.
I swear, this game is like a wild goose chase. Just when I think I’m closing in, it slips away.
Can you believe how tricky this Trojan is? It’s like it knows our every move.
Honestly, I’m feeling a bit defeated right now. We need a better strategy to corner this sneaky little bug.
I don’t know about you all, but I’m starting to feel like we need a miracle to find this Trojan.
Every time we make a guess, it’s like we just end up further away. Maybe we should regroup and brainstorm.
This Trojan must be laughing at us right now. They're definitely playing the long game.
Alright, let’s not lose hope yet! We just need to keep thinking outside the box.
I thought we had a solid plan, but now it feels like we’re just flailing around.
I keep wondering if we’re scanning in the right areas. Maybe we need to rethink our understanding of the map.
I’m starting to question if we’re actually making any progress at all. I mean, how hard can it be to find one sneaky Trojan in this grid?
We definitely need to pick up our game. This isn’t how I imagined the session going!
Honestly, I thought I had a solid lead, but now it feels like we’re spinning our wheels.
If I were the Trojan, I’d be feeling pretty smug right now. We’ve got to do better!
At this point, I’d settle for just a hint. Anything to get us moving in the right direction.
It’s frustrating how close we think we are, only to be thrown off again. I need a new strategy; clearly, this one isn’t cutting it.
Can we agree that the Trojan has some serious stealth skills? It’s definitely keeping us on our toes!
I had a feeling we’d find it sooner. Now I’m just left scratching my head and feeling lost.
What are the odds the Trojan is hiding right under our noses? It’s playing a long game, that’s for sure.
I thought scanning would give us more of an edge, but I’m starting to feel like we’re just wasting our turns here.
Does anyone else feel like we’re in a loop? Scan, search, guess, and repeat—it’s exhausting!
I can’t shake the feeling that we’re missing something important. We really need to rethink our approach here.
Every time I think we have a lead, the Trojan slips right through our fingers.
I wonder if the Trojan is just hiding in plain sight. It seems like the most obvious place is always the last one we check.
I’m not ready to throw in the towel just yet, but man, this is tough. We’ve got to keep our spirits up!
It’s like playing hide-and-seek with a ghost! I just hope we can pin this thing down soon.
At this rate, we might need a miracle to find it. Maybe we should change our scanning patterns up a bit?
I keep thinking we’re onto something, but then nothing. It’s like chasing shadows!
This Trojan is definitely keeping things interesting, if not frustrating. I just want to see a victory for once!
Honestly, it feels like we’re all on different wavelengths. Let’s regroup and strategise. This can’t go on forever!
Can you believe how hard it is to track this Trojan? It feels like they’re playing a completely different game than we are!
I’m starting to think the Trojan is a master of disguise. I’ve scanned and still feel like I’m chasing shadows!
Anyone else feeling a little lost? It’s like the Trojan is two steps ahead of us at every turn!
This is getting intense! I swear, I thought we had it cornered, but now it seems like we’re just spinning our wheels.
I’m starting to wonder if we should change our strategy. Maybe we need to work together more closely to pin down the Trojan!
Every time I scan, I feel like I’m just confirming how little I actually know. It’s both frustrating and exciting!
Does anyone have a plan that’s worked in the past? It feels like we need a new approach to flush this Trojan out.
I thought I had a solid lead, but now I’m just second-guessing everything. It’s like trying to catch smoke with my bare hands!
Why does it feel like the Trojan is just toying with us? This is the most challenging game I’ve played in a while!
I can’t believe how easily the Trojan is evading us! It’s almost impressive how well they’re hiding.
Do you guys think we’re making this harder than it needs to be? Maybe we’re overthinking it and just need to focus on a few key spots.
Every time I scan, it’s like I get more confused. I’m starting to think the Trojan is just messing with our heads!
I feel like we’re all trying to read each other’s minds as much as we are the Trojan’s moves. This is getting wild!
Anyone else feel like we’re running around in circles? I need a break to regroup my thoughts on this!
I thought we were on to something, but this Trojan is clearly a slippery one! It’s like trying to catch a greased pig!
Okay, let’s be real—this is becoming a real brain teaser! I’m impressed by how strategic the Trojan is playing.
We might need to rethink our communication. Maybe sharing our scans in a different way would help us connect the dots.
This game is really testing our teamwork! We need to come together if we want to outsmart this Trojan.
How do you think the Trojan is managing to stay hidden? It’s like they have a sixth sense for avoiding our scans!
If we don’t figure this out soon, I might just start guessing blindly! But then again, that might just play right into the Trojan’s hands!
