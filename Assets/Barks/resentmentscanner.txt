This Trojan is really getting under my skin! I can’t believe how well it’s evading us.
Why does it feel like we're chasing shadows? Seriously, I’m starting to think this Trojan has some tricks up their sleeve!
Can someone remind me how many nodes are left for the Trojan? Because I’m starting to feel like we’re going in circles here!
I swear this game is just a test of our patience at this point. How does Player 0 always seem to be one step ahead?
Honestly, I thought we’d have this figured out by now. This is starting to get very annoying!
Every time I scan, it feels like I’m just throwing darts blindfolded. This is ridiculous.
Let’s face it; we might as well just hand over the victory to the Trojan at this rate.
Can we all agree that this Trojan is having way too much fun right now? We need to turn up the heat!
I can't believe you keep outsmarting us. It's infuriating! Can you just stay still for one second so we can catch you?
Every time I think we're closing in, you somehow vanish into thin air. You must have some secret cheat running that we're not aware of!
You know, it’s really impressive how good you are at hiding. But it's also super annoying! You’re making this way more frustrating than it needs to be.
I swear, you must have some kind of spec-ops training. Just admit it, you enjoy watching us struggle, don’t you?
I’ve had it with your tricks! Why can’t you just let us catch you for once? It’s getting ridiculous.
You know, if we could actually see where you were going, this game would be over by now! Just give us a break!
Every time I get a hint, it feels like you’re somehow halfway across the map. What kind of magic are you using to escape us?
You’re like a slippery eel, aren’t you? Just when I think I've got a grip, you slip away again. It’s downright frustrating!
This is starting to feel like a never-ending chase. Can you at least pretend to make it a little easier for us?
I can’t help but think you’re just toying with us. Are you really that good, or are you just having a laugh at our expense?
You must be getting a kick out of this. Seriously, it’s like you’re just messing with our heads at this point!
Is your strategy just to run away and hide forever? Because that’s definitely working for you right now!
I don’t know if you’re just lucky or if you have some secret skills, but it’s driving me crazy! Can’t you just stand still for a moment?
You keep dodging every single move we make. It’s honestly impressive and frustrating at the same time!
Why do I feel like we’re just running in circles? You’re making this feel like a wild goose chase, and it’s exhausting!
Every time I try to narrow it down, you somehow manage to escape again. It’s getting really old!
I could swear you’re playing some kind of game with us. Are you just waiting for the right moment to reveal yourself?
I can’t believe how easily you evade us. It’s like you’ve got a sixth sense or something! What’s your secret?
You’re the ultimate ghost in this game, aren’t you? Just when I think I see you, poof! You're gone again!
I’m starting to think the Trojan has a personal vendetta against us. What a frustrating situation!
