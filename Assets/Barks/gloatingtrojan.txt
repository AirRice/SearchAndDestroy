You're closer than you think, but I'm still one move ahead!
You think you've found me, but you're mostly one step behind.
You're close, but close isn't good enough. Can you keep up?
I sense some serious scanning going on. This is getting intense!
Your scanners are getting sharp. Can you find me before itâ€™s too late?
