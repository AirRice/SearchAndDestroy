It's so annoying how you seem to know where I am at all times.
Am I doing something wrong here? How are you this close to me all the time?
Wow, you guys are really making this difficult. Do you have some sort of sixth sense or something?
Seriously? Is there a way to get a break from your relentless scanning?
I didn’t realize I was up against a team of scanning experts. This is getting ridiculous!
Great job, Scanners. You’ve made this game way more challenging than I anticipated.
I’ve got to hand it to you all; your scanning skills are on another level. Impressive, but frustrating!
How did you all get so good at this? Feels like every move I make is under a microscope!
I thought I had some tricks up my sleeve, but you guys are proving me wrong with your sharp scanning!
Can you give a Trojan a break? Your scanning is starting to get a bit personal!
It’s almost like you’ve been practicing just to make my life difficult. Nice job, I guess?
I didn’t expect this level of skill from you all. It’s almost like you’re reading my mind!
