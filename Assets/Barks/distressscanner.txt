There's no way we're going to catch up if we keep losing ground like this. We need a better strategy, fast!
This Trojan is way ahead of us. We're not even getting close to figuring out where it is!
At this rate, we're going to lose control of the entire grid. We need to regroup and come up with a new plan.
You're infecting objectives faster than we can track it! We’re seriously falling behind here.
We’re running out of time. We need to make some serious adjustments or we’re going to lose this game.
This Trojan is making us look like amateurs. We need to step up our game or we're done for.
If we don’t find the trojan soon, they’ll have all the objectives and we’ll have nothing left to go on!
Every second we waste, they're getting closer to winning. We need to get our game on.
